<h2>The Basics</h2>
<hr>
<p>What are my aspirations? That's an excellent question. I aspire to make an audience feel connected and derive emotional awareness with the art I make.
    How would I do this? I hope to achieve my goal through taking my experiences and telling thrilling stories. What drives me? Communicating with people is my greatess weakness, I want
    to improve on my speech patterns; I really love to talk when I can, however that does not meant that I do not listen. How are my work ethics? I work efficently and I can also multi-task. I pay attention to the details and strive for the best results.
    Do I have any work experience? What transferable skills did you gain? What did you learn from that experience? I use to work at a daycare for 4 years. In regards to what transferable skills I gained or prefected
    where multitasking, obseverational, and time oriented. What I learned from my four years dedicated there was that I can apply how I worked with kids into the rest of the world wether it was working in retail or an office.

<h2>My character</h2>
<hr>
<p class="para">Just who is Jacynda?</p>
<p id="link">I am firstly a daughter and an older one than that, what does that translate to exactly? It means that I am a team player, I am always able to find compromise, I am a problem solver,
    I am apporachable, I am responsible, and just to top it off I am caring. There are certainly more aspects that were not mentioned to save time, but I also have a few flaws that I am not ashmed of.
    I take pride in every part of me so even though my communication skills are not up to par, I can still express what I am thinking. Of course there are skills that are linked to communication that suffer a bit but everything is a work in progress, 
    and after a few months I have shown extreme signs of growth. I know what I want and know that I have to work to get it, I am prepared to put my time and effort towards the cause.

<h2>My goal</h2>
<hr>
<p>Where do you see yourself in five years? What is your dream job? What do you want to do in the future? Any variation of the question regarding my plan for the future in the I have been time and time again. I always saw myself being a teacher, I even dedicated my time to working at a daycare 
    when I was still in elementary. I love making a plan and sticking to it, of course life won't wait around for me so I also know how to go with the flow and be adaptable. My plan after graduation is to move out after two years into my own apartment, work at a big name company that specalizes 
    in technology. This plan has room for unexpected occurences and is just the outline for the next five years, until I am have reached financial and emotional stability.
