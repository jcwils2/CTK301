<p>I, Jacynda Cheyenne Wilson-Wade, am a second year at Illinois State University, I major in Creative Technology: Game Design. I attended a military high school, and not all the sterotypes of ROTC kids are completely true, 
  here is where I had my frist introduction to coding as a somphomore. Before that class I still wanted to work on games but as a designer instead of a programmer, even though I am not that confident in my art skills, 
  so learning that I was good at coding gave me the confidence that I knew what I wanted to do after highschool. During my first year at Uni I had discovered myself and became contempt with the results. I learned to be more selfish, 
  enforce boundries, protect my peace, say what I want, and develop my fashion sense. In a few years I can see myself comfortable with a respectable position working at Google before moving onto bigger things with a degree that falls 
  into the art catogeory that "wouldn't get me any respect".

  </p>
  <p>Through times where I felt like quitting I had someone in my corner supporting my every step towards progress. I have taught myself that it is okay fo me to take breaks and take care of my person. 
    I now motivate myself through affirmations and repeating outlout that "Roman wasn't built in a day" and "If you're getting frustrated and crying from something that you are doing than you are doing it right and are also in the right field".

<p> Why did I get into creative technology? I grew up with a lot of siblings as I am the 6th oldest, and I have a lot of brothers so when they wanted to play the game they had to share.
  Through video games I created connections and devolped into the charcter that I am today from the games that my older brother had me playing. I will always say this when asked what is my major and why,
  is that I had planned to not waste more of my life attending school. As far as it goes I am an older child so I have to set the example, so I did my research and decided that I was going to do something that I 
  already have a deep love for. I also looked at the adults in my life and how I found their lives a little bit miserable and the outlier was that their career had sucked all the joy out of it. I wanted to be a teacher at 
  first, my communication skills are a challenge and of course the joy was drained the longer I looked into the field, but communication is not always a requirement when making and playing video games.</p>
